I'm a full-stack developer who loves building thoughtful, resilient software, particularly in **Ruby**, **Python**, and **JavaScript**.

I care about writing code that solves real problems and doesn’t fall over in production. I gravitate toward clean, maintainable solutions, and I’m happiest when I get to work across both front-end and back-end systems. I began my software trajectory working on back-end Rails systems using PostgreSQL and extensive third-party and internal APIs.

Prior to pursuing a tech career, I have been a mountain guide, paramedic, addiction counselor, and educator in various settings. I love rock climbing and being in the backcountry. Since 2025, I have been enrolled in the Computer Science BS program at San Francisco State University.

### What I Like Working On

I like turning complex integrations into polished, low-friction UIs. This often involves polling APIs, developing automated scripts and pipelines, and ensuring adequate fall-back services.

I’ve worked on:
- Web apps
- On-site and remote server setup and configuration
- CLI tools
- An wide range of experimental side projects—some polished, some just for fun.
